# Phishing Detector using AI and API

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **hybrid phishing detection system** that combines:
- Rule-based (human-defined) phishing detection
- AI/NLP-based phishing classification
- REST API for real-time analysis

The goal is to detect phishing emails or messages using both traditional security heuristics and machine learning techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect phishing attempts using keyword and pattern analysis
- Enhance detection using AI-based natural language processing
- Expose the detection system via an API
- Build the project in a secure, isolated environment (Kali Linux VM)
